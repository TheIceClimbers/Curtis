      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>The Ice Climbers are Smash Ultimate's traditional tag team duo. What this means is you're effectively controlling two characters. This makes them probably the hardest character to master in the game, this page will feature all the basics you need to start using the Ice Climbers.<p>

    <h2>Why should I care?</h2>
    <p>The Ice Climbers are very underrepresented in the Smash Ultimate community, being one of the least played characters. However, they are the most unique in the game and they're very fun. Even just having 2 characters in 1 is unique and what makes them special, and they deserve more.<p>
