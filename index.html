    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>The Ice Climbers are Smash Ultimate's traditional tag team duo. What this means is you're effectively controlling two characters. This makes them probably the hardest character to master in the game, this page will feature all the basics you need to start using the Ice Climbers.<p>
    <h2>Why should I care?</h2>
    <p>The Ice Climbers are very underrepresented in the Smash Ultimate community. However, they are the most unique in the game and they're very fun. The 2nd Ice Climber getting lucky can save you more often than you think, so I'd suggest at least considering them.<p>
